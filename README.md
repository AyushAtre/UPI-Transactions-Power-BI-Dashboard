This project showcases the end-to-end development of a dynamic UPI Transactions Dashboard, integrating AWS S3, Snowflake, and Power BI. It demonstrates cloud storage management, secure data integration, data modeling, and the creation of an interactive business intelligence dashboard.

# üöÄ Project Workflow
# Data Storage:

Created an AWS S3 Bucket and uploaded UPI transaction data.

Configured an IAM Role for secure access permissions.

Established an Integration Object in Snowflake to connect with S3 and import the dataset.

# Data Import & Modeling:

Imported data into Snowflake for efficient storage and querying.

Connected Power BI to Snowflake using the Get Data feature.

Performed data transformations using Power Query Editor, including the creation of Conditional Columns to categorize and enhance data.

# Dashboard Development:

Designed a highly interactive dashboard using Power BI.

Created 8 dynamic slicers for better data exploration:

Bank Name (Sent)

Bank Name (Received)

City

Device Type

Gender

Age Group

Merchant Name

Payment Mode

Purpose

Transaction Type

Visualized transactional insights using:

Line Charts for trend analysis.

Matrix Visuals for detailed data breakdown.

Enhanced user experience through:

Bookmarks for customized navigation.

Conditional Formatting to highlight critical patterns and anomalies.
